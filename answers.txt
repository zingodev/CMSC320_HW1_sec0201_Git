Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: We use git for a few reasons! It has version control so we can rollback bad changes, supports branching so multiple
changes or contributors can work at the same time, and in general makes managing a large or distrubted code base easier!

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Game development. An example would be optimizing the cost of ingame purchases through AB testing
to maximize revenue.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging is the combinding of two different branches where the history of both the branches and the merge is saved. Rebasing
instead creates an ordered/linear history by rewriting commits from one branch onto another.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: Learning how to use Data Science in the real world. I want to optimize the things I build.
I'm a game developer and I hope a lot of the concepts I learn hear can be applied to my games to make
them more enjoyable and profitable.
